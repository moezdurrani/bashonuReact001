      <p>
        Our website is dedicated to protecting and celebrating the rich musical heritage of the Chitrali people 
        by preserving the cherished songs of the Chitrali languages. As the echoes of these traditional melodies 
        risk fading into obscurity, we have created a dynamic platform where enthusiasts can both upload and access 
        lyrics, ensuring that our cultural treasures are preserved and accessible for generations to come.

      <h2>Why We Need Your Help:</h2>
      <p>
        These songs are more than just music; they are a living history, capturing the essence of our culture and traditions. 
        By contributing lyrics, sharing stories, or simply exploring our collection, you help keep our heritage vibrant and alive.
